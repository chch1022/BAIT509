1. Construct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has $x_1=6$ and $x_2=10$?
Based on the observations, the classfication boundary is x1= 7.5. I would classify this observation as A, since it is similar to most of the type A observation.

2. What size is the margin here?
The size of the margin is 2 here

3. Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?
Observation 6,7,8,9,10 receive a penalty. The support vectors are 6,7,8,9,10

4. What is the total penalty here?
Observations that are penalized by 0.25 points: 6,7
Observations that are penalized by 1.25 points: 8
Observations that are penalized by 1.75 points: 9
Observations that are penalized by 2.25 points: 10
Total penalty = 0.25+0.25+1.25+1.75+2.25=5.75

5. Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?
Yes, because the penalty right now is 5.75, it is allowable to increase the penalty by 0.25

6. Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?
Yes, the support vector are 4,8,9
