1. Candidate A seems to be better fit in this case. 
Pros: While both A and B have an average productivity 75, candidate A has low variance, hence candidate A has a higher chance to score 75. 
We are pretty sure that Candidate A's score will be around 75. For candidate B, although we know his/her expected score will be around 75,
we are less certain what his/her true score is. We are taking less risk by hiring candidate A. 
Cons: Candidate A has lower chance to hit productivity score of more than 75 comparing to candidate B. It is possible for Candidate B to
score as high as 80, but it is almost impossible for candidate A.

2. Candidate B seems to be a good fit in this case. 
Pros: In general, candidate B has a higher productivity.
The plot only serves as a tool when choosing the candidate. In reality, we need to consider from a more comprehensive aspects

3. The probabilisitic forecast is biased. While all true values are above zero, the probabilistic forecasts suggests that there are chances
that the true value could be negative, we might want to tune the parameters.
